In an open circuit test, all current flows through Rc and Xm.
The winding resistance and leakage reactance are negligible
compared to Rc and Xm.

First, the power factor is calculated using the formula:
P = 3*V * I * cosφ

Then, the current components are obtained as:
Ic = I0 * cosφ
Im = I0 * sinφ

Since the voltage across the core branch elements is V1,
the parameters are calculated as:
Rc = V1 / Ic
Xm = V1 / Im

Finally, since X = ωL, the inductance is calculated as:
L = Xm / ω
